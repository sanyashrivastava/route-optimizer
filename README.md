# Route-Optimizer
The Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization project is designed to provide a graphical representation of one of the most widely used shortest path algorithms: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. This interactive tool demonstrates how the algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph, making it easier for users to understand it step-by-step

Methodology
1. Graph Setup: The graph is represented as an adjacency list.

2. Canvas Drawing:Nodes are drawn as circles, with edges between them represented as lines.

3. User Interaction: A "Visualize Algorithm" button initiates the algorithm, and a "Reset" button becomes 
available after the visualization is completed.

4. Algorithm Execution: Dijkstra's algorithm is run, calculating distances and updating the graph dynamically.

5. Visualization & Animation: The process is animated using delays, showing each step visually.

6. Path Reconstruction: After the algorithm finishes, the shortest path is reconstructed and highlighted on the 
graph.
