The Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization project is designed to provide a graphical representation of one of the most widely used shortest path algorithms: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. This interactive tool demonstrates how the algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph, making it easier for users to understand it step-by-step
